Refactor the code provided here to support
single sign-on and proper authorization levels.
Your solution should guarantee the following:

1. Any user can access screens Public1, Public2, Login
2. Users with id = 1 or id = 2 who have logged in may
access Public1, Public2, Login, and Private
3. Users with id = 2 who have logged in may access
all screens.
4. After a user logs out, he may access only Public1, Public 2, Login
5. Once a user logs in, he may access any of the windows
he is authorized to view without logging in again (this is "single sign-on")
6. Whenever a user attempts to login using the Login window, and 
login is not successful, a message should be shown at the bottom
of the login window -- in red -- stating "Login failed"
7. If a user has chosen the "login" option from anywhere in the application,
the Login window should be displayed. If his attempt to login is successful,
a message should be shown at the bottom of the login window -- in green --
stating "Login successful".
8. If a user who has not logged in attempts to access 
Private, the Login window should be displayed. If login is successful,
the Private window should be displayed. 
9. If a user who has not logged in attempts to access AdminOnly,
the Login window should be displayed. If login is successful and the
login name is "2", the AdminOnly window should be displayed. If the
login name is "1" and password is "1", a message, in red, stating
"Not authorized" should be displaed on the Login window. 


Note: Here are the logins for this application:
  userid = 1   password = 1
  userid = 2   password = 2
