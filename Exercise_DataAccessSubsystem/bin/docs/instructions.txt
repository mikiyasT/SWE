Requirements: Use the data access subsystem to 
interact with the database -- use the project
SampleDataAccessSubsystem for reference.

Implement the three methods listed in business.DbClassCatalog
  List<Catalog> getAllCatalogs() 
  int insertNewCatalog(String catalogName) 
  int deleteCatalog(int id) 
  
Data for catalogs is stored in productsdb.catalogtype.

The main method in the Main class provides test code
for your methods. Be careful in the way you modify
the catalogtype table in the database, since it will be used in the
real project later. The main method will ask you
to add a new catalog, grab the new catalog id,
and then delete that same catalog, so the table
will remain unchanged.
