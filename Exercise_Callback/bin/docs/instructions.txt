This application supports login, but does not
protect the Remarks and Grades screens properly.
If a user is not logged in, he can still
access those screens. The code must be refactored
so that if a user tries to access those screens
but is not logged in, then he is taken to the
Login screen. Then, after successful login,
the system should take him to the requested
screen (Remarks or Grades), which will provide
the expected data. Note that when this happens,
the Remarks screen (or Grades screen) should
be populated with data (the TextArea should not be 
empty).

Important: In creating a solution, you are looking
for a good design. There are several ways to accomplish 
this, but for this exercise, aim for minimal coupling
between the Control class and the UI classes. 

Pre-requisite: You should have completed Exercise_LoginAndAuthorization
before attempting this exercise.
